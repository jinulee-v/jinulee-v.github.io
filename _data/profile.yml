  <p>
    My research focuses on <b>Semantics of reasoning</b>, aiming to understand and improve natural language reasoning via neural large language models and symbolic methods. Specifically, I am interested in:
    <ul>
      <li>Neuro-symbolic reasoning (logic, math, code)</li>
      <li>Evaluation of reasoning traces</li>
      <li>Improving reasoning of large language models</li>
    </ul>
